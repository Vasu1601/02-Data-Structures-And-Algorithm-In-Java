You are given a sorted array arr of integers and a target integer target. Your task is to find the ceiling of the 
target number in the given sorted array. The ceiling of the target is the smallest element in the array that is 
greater than or equal to the target. If the target exists in the array, return the target itself. 
If no such element exists, return -1.

Input Test Case 1 ->
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19]
target = 5
Output: 8

Input Test Case 2 ->
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19]
target = 10
Output: 10

Input Test Case 3 ->
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19]
target = 20
Output: -1
